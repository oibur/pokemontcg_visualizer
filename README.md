# pokemontcg_visualizer


***February 26th, 2021***
The last project I worked on returned how many times each Pokemon appeared in the TCG using JSON files downloaded from https://github.com/PokemonTCG. In this project I hope to return more accurate/up-to-date data that I will then also visualize. 
Step 1 - Obtain a dictionary of all Pokemon occurences {Pokemon: Occurences}
Step 2 - Graph the data based on Generations.
